# Migrate Life 2 ðŸ›«

## "Find where you flourish"

> Do you want to live somewhere else? Are you unhappy with where you live? You
> pick anywhere on our map, a list of cities will populate for you based on that
> selection. After, you will be able to refine your selections further by our
> filters to customize where your final locations to pick from will be. Upon
> final filtering, you will be able to save/compare/delete your choices until
> you reach your final decision. All thats left is for you to find that one
> place that fits you. Our application uses the latest and up to date APIs for
> the information that you need to "find where you flourish".
